## Getting Started

It is recommended that you do not view the answers to this challenge, but instead visit [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and work through the challenges yourself. Now, assuming that you are not cheating on the problems for your own good conscience...

1. Clone this project to your local: `git clone https://github.com/ericis/euler.git`
2. `npm i` to install dependencies
3. `npm test` to run the tests

You can view the tests and source code in each numbered directory under `./src`.
